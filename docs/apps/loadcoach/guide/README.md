# LoadCoach

Turns FreeWeight's measurements (or declared capabilities) into routed, queued, validated inference
execution with a fully explainable decision for every job.

**Status:** `1.5.0` in the repository (release prepared, untagged; last tag `v1.1.6`; `pip index versions loadcoach` says what PyPI serves). Every phase of the
[development plan](../development-plan.md) through 11 is built: the registry and
task profiles; evidence-weighted routing with a readable explanation for every decision;
synchronous and streaming generation with validation and corrective retries; a durable priority
queue with leases, ageing, cancellation, recovery and a circuit breaker; FreeWeight evidence
import, now binding an adapter-bearing subject rather than only the bare base; more than one
provider, with adapter subjects that route and pin like any other candidate (LA2/LA3); a complete
operator UI (dashboard, jobs, live queue, models, reliability, system, settings); and the hardening
a LAN bind needs — scopes checked at the route and in the service, per-token rate limits,
per-source queue caps, CSRF, Host validation, body limits, content retention.

Every runtime dependency resolves from PyPI (`weightsdb>=0.2,<0.3`, `mirrorwall>=0.2.2,<0.3`);
`pip install loadcoach` resolves entirely from the index, `requirements/ci.lock` is hash-pinned
against it, and every CI job installs from that lock.

Part of the **Local AI Suite**.

## Install

```bash
pip install loadcoach
loadcoach serve                # web UI + API on http://127.0.0.1:8766, zero configuration
loadcoach doctor               # every documented failure mode, ✓ / ! / ✗, with what to do
```

No provider, no GPU, no FreeWeight is required to start; each absence is a documented degraded
state. Ollama on `127.0.0.1:11434` is the default provider.

## What it does

* **Routes explainably.** Every decision is persisted in full — candidates, per-capability scores
  with their source and age, the four adjustment factors with their inputs, every rejection with
  its numbers — and `/jobs/<id>` answers *why this model?* before it shows a table.
* **Learns from production.** Attempt outcomes and caller feedback become bounded per-model
  reliability statistics that deprioritize a failing model, exclude it through a circuit breaker
  with a re-probe, and flag a regression against the model's own history.
* **Queues durably.** Priority classes, ageing with a proven starvation bound, leases, cancellation
  within a chunk, VRAM-aware admission, residency management, and recovery after a kill that loses
  and duplicates nothing.
* **Exposes safely.** Loopback and open by default; on a LAN, tokens with cumulative scopes checked
  twice, Host validation before authentication, CSRF on forms, rate limits with `Retry-After`,
  and a `doctor` that names what is wrong.

## Compatibility

Declared version ranges from `pyproject.toml` — kept from drifting by
`tests/unit/test_readme_compatibility.py`, which parses the file and fails if this table disagrees:

| Package | Range |
|---|---|
| `baseaicore` | `>=0.4.2,<0.5` |
| `setspec` | `>=0.6,<0.7` |
| `modelrack` | `>=0.8,<0.9` |
| `sweatmeter` | `>=0.4,<0.5` |
| `weightsdb` | `>=0.2,<0.3` |
| `mirrorwall` | `>=0.2.2,<0.3` |
